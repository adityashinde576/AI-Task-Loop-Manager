# AI Task Loop Manager – Mini Project

A beginner-friendly Python mini project that demonstrates how loops, functions, and loop control statements like `break` work in AI-style task simulations.  
The project simulates an AI system performing tasks step-by-step and stopping early based on a condition.

---

## 🧠 Project Aim

- Understand how to create and use functions  
- Learn how loops work in Python  
- Practice using loop control (`break`)  
- Simulate task progress similar to AI system logs  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use `def` to define reusable functions  
- Use `for` loops with `range()` to create step-by-step processes  
- Display progress updates using print statements  
- Demonstrate early stopping logic using `break`  

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Function-based program (`run_task`)  
- Visual step-by-step task progress  
- Early stopping at step 5  
- Simple AI-like progress tracking  
- Beginner-friendly, no external libraries needed  

---

## 📜 Code Overview

### **run_task(n)**
- Takes `n` → total number of steps expected  
- Loops from step 1 to `n`  
- Prints progress for each step  
- Stops early when step 5 is reached
